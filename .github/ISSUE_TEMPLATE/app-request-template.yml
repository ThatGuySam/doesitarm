      ### Before you start

      Check out [Issue #358](https://github.com/ThatGuySam/doesitarm/issues/358) for a great issue example

      ### Issue etiquette

      When opening an issue, please:
      - Check for an [existing issue](https://github.com/ThatGuySam/doesitarm/issues) first. If someone else has opened an issue describing the same problem, please upvote their issue rather than creating another one.
      - Provide as much detail as possible. The more detail you are able to provide, the better!
      - Write issues primarily in English.
