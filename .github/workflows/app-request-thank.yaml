        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({

              The next step is to collect any missing info.

              I'm currently working on getting to all the requests,
              however, if you'd like help push things along feel free
              to add what's missing as you find it.

              You can reference what all it needs here:
              [App Request Template](https://github.com/ThatGuySam/doesitarm/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/app-request-template.md)`
            })
